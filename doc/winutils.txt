REQUIREMENTS                                    *winutils-requirements*

This plug-in is only available if 'compatible' is not set. It also relies on
Vim 8 features, specifically |windowid|s and their associated functions. If
`exists('*win_findbuf')` is true for you, your version of Vim is probably
compatible.

OVERVIEW                                        *winutils-overview*

This plug-in provides utilities for working with windows, tabs, and buffers.

                                                *:Lsw*
:Lsw        List all windows across all tab pages. The format resembles that of
|:ls|; see the documentation there for the format of the `state` field. Here is an
example of its output in a session editing this plug-in's files: >

    tabnr winnr winid bufnr state
        1     1  1008     4    a+ "doc/winutils.txt" line 0
        1     2  1002     2     a "autoload/winutils.vim" line 1
        1     3  1000     1     a "plugin/winutils.vim" line 12
        2     1  1005     3     a "~/.vimrc" line 0

                                                *:FindWin*
:FindWin    Find all windows containing the given buffer and list their tabs,
window numbers, and window IDs. The buffer is specified by name. Completion on
buffer names is provided. Fails if the buffer name is ambiguous or can't be
found.

                                                *:GotoWin*
:GotoWin    Attempt to go to a window containing the given buffer. If the
buffer does not exist, displays an error. If there is a single window
containing the buffer, goes to it. If there are multiple windows containing
the buffer, you are prompted to select which one. Completion on buffer names
is provided.

SETTINGS                                        *winutils-settings*
                                                *winutils-config*
